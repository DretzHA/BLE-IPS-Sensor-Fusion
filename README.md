# BLE-IPS-Sensor-Fusion

This repository was disponibilized to realize the sensor fusion using Angle-RSSI Fusion Localization (ARFL) with the dataset provide by Girolami et. al. 

The detail about ARFL can be read in the article:
A. Fabris, O. K. Rayel, J.L. Rebelatto, G. L. Moritz, and R. D. Souza, "AoA And RSSI-based BLE Indoor Positioning System wtih Kalman Filter and Data Fusion".

The dataset is available for download in:
